When using a build system like the Yocto Project, initializing a build environment that differs from the original environment used to create it can lead to build failures. Let's break down why this happens:

### Consistency and Dependencies in Build Environments

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Build systems often rely on a specific set of tools, libraries, and configurations to function correctly. These dependencies need to be consistent across different build environments to ensure that the build process runs smoothly.

2. **Tool Versions**:
   - Different versions of tools and libraries can produce different results or introduce compatibility issues. For instance, a newer version of a compiler might generate different binary code than the version originally used, or it might have different bugs or features that affect the build.

3. **Configuration Settings**:
   - The configuration settings of the build environment, including environment variables, compiler flags, and paths to libraries, need to be consistent. If these settings differ, the build process might not find the necessary files or use incorrect settings, leading to build failures.

### Specific Issues Leading to Build Failures

1. **Library Mismatches**:
   - If the build environment has different versions of libraries than those used in the original environment, there might be API or ABI incompatibilities. This can cause compilation or linking errors.

2. **Path Differences**:
   - The build system might rely on certain paths for finding tools and libraries. If these paths differ between environments, the build system might not locate the required resources, leading to failures.

3. **Toolchain Differences**:
   - A toolchain consists of the compiler, linker, assembler, and other tools used to build the software. Differences in the toolchain can lead to inconsistencies in the generated binaries, or even build errors if certain tools are missing or incompatible.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Environment variables play a crucial role in configuring the build process. Different values or missing environment variables can alter the behavior of the build system, leading to failures.

### Example Scenario

Imagine you have a build system configured with the following environment:

- **Original Build Environment**:
  - GCC version 9.3.0
  - Library `libfoo` version 1.2.3 located at `/usr/lib/libfoo.so`
  - Environment variable `CFLAGS` set to `-O2 -Wall`

Now, consider a different environment:

- **New Build Environment**:
  - GCC version 10.2.0
  - Library `libfoo` version 1.3.0 located at `/usr/local/lib/libfoo.so`
  - Environment variable `CFLAGS` set to `-O3 -Wextra`

### Potential Issues

1. **GCC Version**:
   - The new GCC version might introduce different optimizations, warnings, or errors that were not present in the original version, causing build failures or differences in the generated binaries.

2. **Library Version and Path**:
   - The new version of `libfoo` might have changes that are not compatible with the code, leading to compilation or runtime errors. Additionally, the different library path could cause linking errors if the build system is not configured to find the new path.

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - The different `CFLAGS` settings could result in different compiler behaviors, potentially leading to build failures due to stricter warnings or different optimizations.

### Summary

Using a build system in an environment different from the one originally used can lead to build failures due to:

- Differences in tool and library versions.
- Inconsistent paths and configurations.
- Changes in environment variables.
- Toolchain incompatibilities.

To avoid such issues, it's crucial to maintain a consistent build environment or use tools like containers or virtual machines to replicate the original environment accurately. The Yocto Project itself provides mechanisms to create reproducible builds by encapsulating dependencies and configurations within its recipes and metadata.


### Important points:
* A build system always has to include metadata layers, which provide recipes and configuration files.
* When you **create a build environment with the `oe-init-build-env` script** of the build system, the script automatically sets up a `conf/bblayers.conf` file that includes the **three base layers**: 
    * `meta`
    * `meta-yocto-bsp`
    * `meta-yocto.`

These base layers are sufficient to build the standard Poky reference distribution. However, **as an embedded Linux developer, you eventually want to create your own distribution, add your own software packages, and potentially provide your own BSP for your target hardware**. This goal is accomplished by including other metadata layers with the build system.
