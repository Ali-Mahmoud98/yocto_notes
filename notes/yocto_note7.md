## Metadata Layer Structure
Metadata layers are containers to group and organize recipes, classes, configuration files, and other metadata into logical entities. Layers commonly build on and extend each other.

The **OE Core layer** forms a foundation for the layer architecture of the Poky build system. **It provides recipes for a core set of software packages** that are needed by most Linux OS stacks, including, of course, the Linux kernel but also bootloaders, graphics, networking, and many other packages.
